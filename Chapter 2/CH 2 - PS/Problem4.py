# Use comparison operators to find out whether a given variable is greater than 'b' or not. For example, if the value is 34, then check if it is equal to 80.
a = 34
b = 80
# Check if 'a' is greater than 'b'
result = a > b
print(result) # This will print True if 'a' is greater than 'b', otherwise False
