# This is a simple Python module that imports the pyjokes library
# and prints a random joke to the console.# Make sure to install the pyjokes library before running this code
# You can install it using pip:
# pip install pyjokes

import pyjokes
joke = pyjokes.get_joke()
print(joke)



# this is a multiline comment
